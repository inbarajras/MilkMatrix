<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a React Native Expo mobile application for dairy farm employees to record milk production and health events. The app integrates with Supabase for data storage and includes QR scanning functionality for cattle identification.

## Key Technologies
- React Native with Expo
- Supabase for backend services
- React Navigation for navigation
- Expo Camera for QR code scanning
- React Native Paper for UI components

## Code Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow React Native best practices
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Use TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Follow the existing code patterns from the web application
- Ensure mobile-optimized UI/UX
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully

## Database Integration
- Use Supabase client for all database operations
- Follow the same data models as the web application
- Implement proper authentication flow
- Use real-time subscriptions where appropriate

## Mobile-Specific Considerations
- Optimize for both iOS and Android
- Handle device permissions properly (camera, storage)
- Implement proper loading states and feedback
- Consider offline data storage for poor connectivity areas
- Use responsive design principles for different screen sizes
