# Field Mapping Issue Resolution

## Health Events Issue Analysis

### Problem
The mobile app was experiencing errors with the message: "Could not find the 'treatment' column of 'health_events' in the schema cache" when creating health records.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Field name mismatch between UI and database:
   - UI used `treatment` as a field name
   - Database schema uses `medications` as a JSONB array field
   
2. The UI's `TextInput` component labeled "Treatment" was trying to save directly to a non-existent `treatment` column.

### Solution
In `RecordHealthScreen.js`, the issue has been properly resolved by mapping the UI's `treatment` input to the database's `medications` field as a JSONB array:

```javascript
const healthData = {
  cow_id: selectedCow.id,
  event_type: eventType.trim(),
  event_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  status: status,
  description: description.trim(),
  medications: treatment.trim() ? [{ name: treatment.trim() }] : [], // Store treatment as medications JSONB array
  notes: notes.trim() || null,
  performed_by: 'Mobile App User',
};
```

This correctly transforms a single treatment string into a JSONB array with an object structure that matches the database schema requirement.

## QR Code Parsing Issue Analysis

### Problem
QR scanning components had inconsistent handling of QR code formats - some expecting direct UUIDs, others JSON objects.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Multiple implementations of QR code parsing across different screens
2. Lack of consistent handling between direct IDs and JSON objects with IDs
3. Missing centralized utility for extraction logic

### Solution
1. Created a shared utility function in `src/utils/qrCodeUtils.js`:

```javascript
export const extractCowIdFromQR = (scannedData) => {
  // Default to using scanned data directly
  let cowId = scannedData;
  
  // Check if the scanned data is a JSON string
  try {
    const jsonData = JSON.parse(scannedData);
    // If it's a JSON object with an id field, use that ID
    if (jsonData && jsonData.id) {
      cowId = jsonData.id;
      console.log('Extracted cow ID from JSON:', cowId);
    }
  } catch (parseError) {
    // Not JSON, assume it's a direct UUID string
    console.log('Using scanned data directly as ID');
  }
  
  return cowId;
};
```

2. Updated all QR scanning components to use this shared utility:
   - QRScanScreen.js
   - RecordMilkScreen.js
   - RecordHealthScreen.js

## Recommendations

1. **Create a Field Mapping Constants File**:
   - Create a dedicated constants file that maps UI field names to database column names
   - Use this for consistent mapping across all components

2. **Use TypeScript Models/Interfaces**:
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for both UI models and database models
   - Create mapping functions between these models

3. **Validation Layer**:
   - Implement a validation layer that checks data against database schema before submission
   - This would catch field name mismatches earlier

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update DATABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md to clearly indicate that the UI's "treatment" maps to database "medications"
   - Add a note about the JSON structure needed for the medications field

5. **Testing**:
   - Add specific unit tests for field mappings
   - Create integration tests for record creation with all possible field combinations

## Verification Steps

To verify this solution continues to work:

1. Create a health record using the "Treatment" field
2. Check the database to ensure the value is correctly stored in the "medications" JSONB array
3. Test QR scanning with both direct UUIDs and JSON objects containing IDs
4. Verify that previously created records with treatments can be properly displayed

The solution that's been implemented properly handles the field mapping issue and should prevent future occurrences of this error.
