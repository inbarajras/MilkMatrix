# Navigation Pattern Fixes for MilkMatrix App

## Problem
The app was experiencing an issue where multiple tabs were being opened instead of properly navigating between screens. This occurred because some screens were using direct tab navigation (`navigation.navigate('TabName')`) instead of the proper nested navigation pattern.

## Solution
Updated all navigation calls from tab screens to use the correct nested navigation pattern:

```javascript
// INCORRECT pattern (causes duplicate tabs)
navigation.navigate('RecordMilk')

// CORRECT pattern (properly navigates between tabs)
navigation.navigate('MainTabs', { screen: 'RecordMilk' })
```

## Files Updated
1. `/Applications/MilkMatrix/src/screens/HomeScreen.js`
   - Fixed navigation to RecordMilk, RecordHealth, and MilkRecords tabs

2. `/Applications/MilkMatrix/src/screens/MilkRecordsScreen.js`
   - Fixed FAB button navigation to RecordMilk tab

3. `/Applications/MilkMatrix/src/screens/HealthRecordsScreen.js`
   - Fixed FAB button navigation to RecordHealth tab

## Navigation Structure Review
The app uses a combination of stack and tab navigation:

1. **Main Stack Navigator** (`AppNavigator.js`)
   - Contains `MainTabs` (Tab Navigator)
   - Contains `QRScan` (Stack Screen)

2. **Tab Navigator** (`MainTabNavigator` in `AppNavigator.js`)
   - Contains Home, RecordMilk, RecordHealth, MilkRecords, and HealthRecords screens

## Navigation Rules
- When navigating between tab screens, always use the pattern:
  ```javascript
  navigation.navigate('MainTabs', { screen: 'TabName', params: { /* any params */ } })
  ```
- For stack screens like QRScan, continue to use:
  ```javascript 
  navigation.navigate('QRScan')
  ```

## Testing
After implementing these fixes, the app now correctly navigates between screens without creating duplicate tabs or causing navigation stack issues.
