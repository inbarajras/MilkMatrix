# MilkMatrix - Technical Solutions Applied

## ✅ RESOLVED: Node.js Compatibility Issues

### Problem
The app was failing to bundle due to Supabase's real-time client trying to import Node.js modules (`ws`, `stream`, etc.) that aren't available in React Native.

### Solution Applied
1. **Downgraded Supabase**: Used `@supabase/supabase-js@2.38.0` (better RN compatibility)
2. **Metro Configuration**: Added polyfills and module aliases in `metro.config.js`
3. **Polyfill Installation**: 
   - `readable-stream` (for stream module)
   - `buffer` (for buffer operations)
   - `expo-crypto` (for crypto functions)
   - `events` (for event handling)
   - `react-native-get-random-values` (for crypto random)
4. **Mock Realtime**: Created mock realtime client to bypass WebSocket issues
5. **Supabase Configuration**: Disabled real-time features in Supabase client

### Current Working Configuration

**metro.config.js**:
```javascript
// Aliases Node.js modules to React Native compatible versions
// Blocks problematic packages (ws, realtime-js)
// Uses mock realtime client
```

**supabase.js**:
```javascript
// Uses older Supabase version (2.38.0)
// Disables real-time features
// Uses AsyncStorage for session persistence
// Includes polyfill imports
```

### Features Working
- ✅ Authentication (login/logout)
- ✅ Database operations (CRUD)
- ✅ QR code scanning (using expo-camera)
- ✅ Milk/health record management
- ✅ Navigation and UI
- ❌ Real-time subscriptions (disabled for compatibility)

## ✅ RESOLVED: Camera Module Migration

### Problem
The expo-barcode-scanner library (version 13.0.1) was deprecated in Expo SDK 50 and removed in SDK 52. The app needed to be updated to use the expo-camera module for barcode scanning.

### Solution Applied
1. **Migrated to expo-camera**: Completely replaced `expo-barcode-scanner` with `expo-camera` API
2. **Updated app.json**: Removed deprecated plugin configuration
3. **Updated package.json**: Removed expo-barcode-scanner dependency
4. **Updated QRScanner component**: 
   - Uses `CameraView` instead of `BarCodeScanner`
   - Uses `Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()` for permissions
   - Added multiple barcode type support
5. **Enhanced error handling**: Better user feedback for camera issues
6. **Cleaned up patches**: Removed obsolete Kotlin compatibility patches

### Code Changes
**QRScanner.js**:
```javascript
// Old: import { BarCodeScanner } from 'expo-barcode-scanner';
// New: import { CameraView, Camera } from 'expo-camera';

// Old: BarCodeScanner.requestPermissionsAsync()
// New: Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()

// Old: <BarCodeScanner onBarCodeScanned={...} />
// New: <CameraView onBarcodeScanned={...} barcodeScannerSettings={{...}} />
```

### Development Commands

# Start development server
npx expo start --clear

# Test on iOS simulator
Press 'i' in terminal

# Test on Android emulator  
Press 'a' in terminal

# Test in web browser
Press 'w' in terminal
```

## ✅ RESOLVED: QR Scanning Error (PGRST116)

### Problem
QR scanning was failing with error: `{"code": "PGRST116", "details": "The result contains 0 rows", "hint": null, "message": "JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned"}` when scanning a cow tag number.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Supabase `.single()` Issue**: Using `.single()` throws PGRST116 when no rows match
2. **QR Code Content**: Using tag numbers instead of primary keys (IDs)
3. **Test Data Creation**: Auto-creating test cows added complexity and potential data issues

### Solution Applied
1. **API Methods Fixed**:
   - Replaced `.single()` with `.maybeSingle()` in `cowService.getCowById()`
   - Added proper error handling for non-existent records
   - Updated all service methods to handle empty results properly

2. **QR Scanning Flow Changed**:
   - Now using cow ID (UUID) instead of tag number for cow lookups
   - Added support for both direct UUIDs and JSON objects with UUID fields
   - Created centralized `extractCowIdFromQR()` utility function for consistent parsing
   - Implemented QR code parsing in all relevant screens (QRScanScreen, RecordMilkScreen, RecordHealthScreen)
   - Removed test data creation functionality
   - Added clear error messages for non-existent IDs

3. **Navigation Fixed**:
   - Fixed navigation from QRScanScreen to tab-based screens
   - Updated navigation to properly handle nested navigators
   - Used correct navigation pattern: `navigation.navigate('MainTabs', { screen: 'RecordMilk', params: { cow } })`

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated README.md to specify QR codes should contain UUIDs
   - Created QR_SCANNING_GUIDE.md with detailed instructions
   - Added technical notes for developers

### Files Modified
- `src/services/cowService.js`
- `src/services/milkService.js`
- `src/services/healthService.js`
- `src/screens/QRScanScreen.js`
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.js`
- `src/utils/testHelpers.js`
- `README.md`

### If Issues Persist
1. Clear all caches: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
2. Reset Metro: `npx expo start --clear`
3. Check Node.js version: Use Node 16-18 (avoid Node 19+)
4. Verify package versions match `package.json` exactly
5. Verify QR codes contain valid UUIDs from the cows table

This configuration has been tested and works reliably for React Native Expo development.

## ✅ RESOLVED: Database Field Name Mismatch (PGRST204)

### Problem
Milk record creation was failing with error: `{"code": "PGRST204", "details": null, "hint": null, "message": "Could not find the 'fat_content' column of 'milk_production' in the schema cache"}`

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Column Name Mismatch**: Frontend code was using field names (`fat_content`, `protein_content`, `quantity`) that did not match the actual database column names (`fat`, `protein`, `amount`)
2. **Inconsistent Naming**: UI field names and database column names were inconsistent across the application
3. **Lack of Documentation**: Field mappings between UI and database were not documented

### Solution Applied
1. **Code Updates**:
   - Updated `RecordMilkScreen.js` to use correct field names matching database schema
   - Changed `fat_content` to `fat` 
   - Changed `protein_content` to `protein`
   - Changed `quantity` to `amount`

2. **Documentation Created**:
   - Created `DATABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md` with detailed mappings between UI and database fields
   - Updated README.md to reference the field mapping documentation
   - Added technical notes about the issue and solution

### Files Modified
- `src/screens/RecordMilkScreen.js`
- `README.md`
- Created new file: `DATABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md`

### Preventing Future Issues
- Always refer to `DATABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md` before adding new fields
- Consider adding validation layer between UI and database operations
- Use TypeScript interfaces to enforce schema consistency (future improvement)

## ✅ RESOLVED: Health Events Field Mapping

### Problem
Health record creation was failing with error: `"Could not find the 'treatment' column of 'health_events' in the schema cache"`

### Root Cause Analysis
- Field name mismatch: UI using `treatment` but database schema uses `medications` as JSONB field
- No schema validation at the application level
- Inadequate documentation of field mappings

### Solution Applied
1. **Fixed RecordHealthScreen.js**:
   - Modified `handleSaveHealthRecord()` to store treatment data in the `medications` JSONB field
   - Converted single treatment string to a proper array format with object structure
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

2. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Added `treatment` field mapping to `DATABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md`
   - Clarified that `treatment` in UI maps to `medications` in database
   - Added technical notes about the fix

### Preventing Future Issues
- Always refer to `DATABASE_FIELD_MAPPING.md` before adding new fields
- Consider adding validation layer between UI and database operations
- Use TypeScript interfaces to enforce schema consistency (future improvement)

## ✅ RESOLVED: Navigation Issues (Multiple Tabs Opening)

### Problem
The app was creating multiple instances of the same tab when navigating between screens, causing confusion and incorrect application state.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Incorrect Navigation Pattern**: Direct navigation to tab screens (`navigation.navigate('TabName')`) created duplicates
- **Nested Navigation Complexity**: App uses a combination of Stack and Tab navigators, requiring proper nested navigation

### Solution Applied
1. **Updated Navigation Pattern**:
   - Changed all navigation calls from tab screens to use proper nested navigation:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from
   navigation.navigate('RecordMilk')
   
   // To
   navigation.navigate('MainTabs', { screen: 'RecordMilk' })
   ```

2. **Screens Fixed**:
   - `HomeScreen.js`: Fixed navigation to RecordMilk, RecordHealth and MilkRecords
   - `MilkRecordsScreen.js`: Fixed FAB button navigation to RecordMilk
   - `HealthRecordsScreen.js`: Fixed FAB button navigation to RecordHealth

3. **Documentation Created**:
   - Added `NAVIGATION_FIXES.md` with detailed explanation of the navigation structure
   - Added comments in navigation code to clarify proper patterns

### Testing
All navigation paths have been tested and verified to work correctly without creating duplicate tabs or causing navigation stack issues.
